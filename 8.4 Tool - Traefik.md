Traefik is an [open-source](https://github.com/traefik/traefik) _Edge Router_ that makes publishing your services a fun and easy experience. It receives requests on behalf of your system and finds out which components are responsible for handling them. 

What sets Traefik apart, besides its many features, is that it automatically discovers the right configuration for your services. The magic happens when Traefik inspects your infrastructure, where it finds relevant information and discovers which service serves which request. 

 Si tratta di un esempio di load balancer in grado di operare già senza dockerfile o immagini personalizzate.Ha bisogno però che per ogni servizio siano indicati dei label, che permettano di indicare quale servizio ha che importanza. 

Traefik is natively compliant with every major cluster technology, such as Kubernetes, Docker, Docker Swarm, AWS, and [the list goes on](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/providers/overview/); and can handle many at the same time. (It even works for legacy software running on bare metal.)

With Traefik, there is no need to maintain and synchronize a separate configuration file: everything happens automatically, in real time (no restarts, no connection interruptions). With Traefik, you spend time developing and deploying new features to your system, not on configuring and maintaining its working state. 

Developing Traefik, our main goal is to make it effortless to use, and we're sure you'll enjoy it.

Traefik is based on the concept of EntryPoints, Routers, Middlewares and Services.
The main features include dynamic configuration, automatic service discovery, and support for multiple backends and protocols.

- [EntryPoints](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/routing/entrypoints/ "Link to docs about EntryPoints"): EntryPoints are the network entry points into Traefik. They define the port which will receive the packets, and whether to listen for TCP or UDP.
- [Routers](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/routing/routers/ "Link to docs about routers"): A router is in charge of connecting incoming requests to the services that can handle them.
- [Middlewares](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/middlewares/overview/ "Link to docs about middlewares"): Attached to the routers, middlewares can modify the requests or responses before they are sent to your service
- [Services](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/routing/services/ "Link to docs about services"): Services are responsible for configuring how to reach the actual services that will eventually handle the incoming requests.

# It's an Edge Router

Traefik is an _Edge Router_; this means that it's the door to your platform, and that it intercepts and routes every incoming request: it knows all the logic and every [rule](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/routing/routers/#rule "Link to docs about routing rules") that determine which services handle which requests (based on the _path_, the _host_, _headers_, etc.).

## Auto Service Discovery

![[Auto Service Discovery Traefik.png]]
Where traditionally edge routers (or reverse proxies) need a configuration file that contains every possible route to your services, Traefik gets them from the services themselves.
Deploying your services, you attach information that tells Traefik the characteristics of the requests the services can handle.

This means that when a service is deployed, Traefik detects it immediately and updates the routing rules in real time. Similarly, when a service is removed from the infrastructure, the corresponding route is deleted accordingly.
You no longer need to create and synchronize configuration files cluttered with IP addresses or other rules.

In the example above, we used the request path rule to determine which service was in charge. Certainly, you can use many other different rules.

- Updating the requests
In the middleware section, you can learn about how to update the requests before forwarding them to the services.

- How does Traefik discover the services?
Traefik is able to use your cluster API to discover the services and read the attached information. In Traefik, these connectors are called providers because they provide the configuration to Traefik.
